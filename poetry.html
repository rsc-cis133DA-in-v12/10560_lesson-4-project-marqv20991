        <!--  I utilized 3 different practices. 
            The first goal was to align the content with search intent using 
            keywords such as poem and daily poems. Secondly, I leveraged primary 
            keywords and rely on them heavily. Lastly, the title tags are interesting.  
            The keywords selected would bring about results relating to a daily poem 
            about language with my name as a reference. Should the page gain in popularity,
            my page name would by synonymous with daily posted poems -->

        <h2>And That Language</h2>
        <!--Because the word "language" is used inside of this slogan, it is
        vital to the poem that the reader consider the extent of language. In this
        context, "you and your" refers to a person in which the author has become
        enamored with.  By selecting the emphasis on these key words, a subtle, yet 
        important emphasis is created.  Bold is not appropriate as it may distract. 
        Italics could also be used as it produces a similar effect.  However, emphasis
        is the key word for the poem as well as the html coding. -->
        <p>By Lawrence Joseph</p>
        
        <p>And that language that parts the future from the past

            the poet slips into,</p>
        
        <p>two people the same pulse the sounds around the poem-was it September?-</p>
            
        <p>saxophone and mandolin sounds on the radio,</p>
            
        <p>a grammar of trees in the wind in the leaves in ecstasies of grace,</p>
            
        <p>this company of love—<em>you</em>, at first sight; <em>you</em>-a language,</p>
                        
        <p>the softest touch a language; beauty’s
            
            eyes, <em>your</em> eyes,</p>

            <!-- While not entirely a complete sentence in its own right, emphasis on "you and 
                your" suggests the added importance to the person being described in the poem. 
                This engages and invites the reader to place a larger emphasis on the idea of 
                whom. -->
